# Insurance Cost Drivers Analysis  

**Exploratory and inferential analysis of a health insurance dataset using univariate, bivariate, and statistical testing to identify cost drivers, risk factors, and regional health trends.**

---

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes a health insurance dataset containing demographic, lifestyle, and cost information for over 1,300 insured individuals.  
The goal is to uncover key relationships between health factors and medical expenses through statistical analysis and visualization.  

Using Python, the project applies **univariate, bivariate, and inferential analysis** to identify how variables such as **BMI, smoking status, and region** influence insurance charges.  
The results provide insights that can support fair pricing models, targeted health interventions, and improved resource allocation within the healthcare industry.

## Key Objectives  
- Explore variable distributions through **univariate analysis**  
- Examine relationships between key variables via **bivariate analysis**  
- Perform **inferential statistical testing** using:  
  - Welch’s *t*-test to assess mean differences in medical charges between smokers and non-smokers  
  - Kruskal–Wallis H-test to compare median BMI values across U.S. regions  
- Visualize findings using histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, and correlation metrics

## Analytical Highlights  
**Univariate Analysis:**  
- Right-skewed distribution of medical charges  
- Near-normal distribution of BMI centered around 30  

**Bivariate Analysis:**  
- Weak but statistically significant positive correlation between BMI and medical charges  
- Smokers exhibited substantially higher charges compared to non-smokers  

**Inferential Testing:**  
- **Welch’s t-test:** Confirmed a significant difference in mean charges between smokers and non-smokers (p < 0.05)  
- **Kruskal–Wallis test:** Detected significant regional differences in median BMI values across U.S. regions

## Business Insights  
- Smoking is a major cost driver, justifying premium adjustments and targeted cessation programs  
- Regional disparities in BMI suggest the need for localized health initiatives  
- Combining demographic and behavioral factors improves risk assessment accuracy for insurers  


---

## Results Summary  
- **Smokers incur significantly higher medical charges** compared to non-smokers  
- **BMI varies significantly across regions**, indicating geographic health disparities  
- Statistical evidence supports strategic adjustments in insurance pricing and public health planning  

---

## Future Improvements  
- Include socioeconomic and lifestyle factors to refine predictive accuracy  
- Develop regression or machine learning models for premium prediction  
- Automate data reporting and visualization dashboards using Power BI or Tableau
